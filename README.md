# About the project

This project was developed to build a chatbot called HECA, which is an intent-based chatbot. It can be potentially used by hospitals and clinics in times of sickness, by suggesting proper remedies at the desired time. It is an interactive application software that runs on the web. User/patient can have a conversation with the bot and input their questions/symptoms. In return, the bot uses an intent-based dataset along with NLP, TensorFlow and Keras to respond to the user. The response contains details about the disease/issue the user might have.

[intents.json](https://github.com/Komalks0212/HECA_Chatbot/blob/master/intents.json): This file contains the dataset

[HECA CODE .ipynb](https://github.com/Komalks0212/HECA_Chatbot/blob/master/HECA%20CODE%20.ipynb): Backend file that contains code used to train the algorithm, chose the right response to the user and code for the GUI.
